This is a DIY numpad that can be cut from many 2-3mm sheet goods, just make sure that your laser can handle it.  The one in the pictures is made from 3mm "Masonite" hardboard and painted with Rustoleum textured black. You will need screws.  I used #4-40 1/2" hex-head and ground down the excess length, but M3 should work as well.  You will probably want furniture bumpons or some other adhesive feet for grip.

The cut file includes holes suitable for mouting a Raspberry Pi Pico on headers.  One of the images is the wiring diagram for the specific RP2040 board I used.

Main.py is used with KMK keyboard firmware and would only work as expected if you use an RP2040 with an identical pinout.
